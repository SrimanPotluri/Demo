# Demo

Technology Stack:

1. Spring boot web starter, Spring Data Redis, Jedis, Gson
2. AWS ec2 - running spring boot app within the docker container
3. AWS Elastic Cache - Redis (key value based storage)
4. Docker hub

Links:

1. docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sriman718/latestdemo
2. postman client simulation video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RBU_9mSpeo8Gs4MhtTQRONykPaN9pzsZ/view?usp=sharing 

Challenges:

Docker, AWS deployment difficulties, since I haven't used these some of technologies before. Therefore, I had time to only simulate with
the postman client and you could simulate too as the system resides on AWS.

Time to completion:

2 days

Future enhnacements:

Build a front end and have its own container with nginx. Manages all the container with docker-compose.
